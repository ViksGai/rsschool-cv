# About Myself

  I have more than 5 years of experience in marketing and brand strategy. Now I live in Poland and am looking for a new profession. Development is interesting for me, because I had to work with different web projects when I was a marketing manager. And I've always wanted to know how it works on the other side. 

 I started learning the Front-end from the beginning, using various resources and schools, for example, HTML Academy, Udemy and free videos from YouTube.

 It's not easy to change my life and choose a new profession, but I really love to study, I feel happy when I see my good result, and this motivates me to be the best and do more and more.
